    "In cryptography, a Caesar shift is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet. For example, with a shift of `-3`, `D` would be replaced by `A`, `E` would become `B`, and so on. The method is named after Julius Caesar, who used it in his private correspondence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a function `caesar_shift()` that takes 2 arguments: a `message` to be encoded/decoded, and a `shift` amount.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Include comments in your function to explain your approach to solving this problem.\n",
    "* Write documentation for the function that can be accessed using the `help()` function.\n",
    "* A positive `shift` should result in a message in which each letter of the message has advanced through the alphabet the requested number of letters.  A negative shift has the opposite affect.\n",
    "  * For example, if the `shift` is `1`, then an `A` will become a `B`, a `B` will become a `C`, a `Y` will become a `Z`, and a `Z` will wrap around the alphabet and become an `A`.  A negative `shift` works in reverse.\n",
    "* Capital letters should only be replaced with capital letters.\n",
    "* Lower case letters should only be replaced with lower case letters.\n",
    "* Any other characters should pass through unaltered.\n",
    "\n",
    "A quick example:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `print(caesar_shift(\"Dog\", 1))` should print `Eph`.  Likewise, `print(caesar_shift(\"Eph\", 1))` should print `Fqi`.  Finally, `print(caesar_shift(\"Fqi\", -2))` should undo both of the prior shifts, and print `Dog`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hints:\n",
    "\n",
    "* This program is much more complicated than your earlier programs.  Don't panic.  Rather, think through this in small steps.\n",
    "  * Pretend that you only have a single character.  How would you perform the Caesar shift on just that one character?\n",
    "  * You know that you will need to step through `message` one character at a time, so how do you do that?\n",
    "  * You need to detect if the character is upper case, lower case, or something else.  Remember that the `string` library has several ways to perform these tests, as well as the `in` syntax.\n",
    "  * You know that you will need to \"build up\" a new string.  How can you do that?  There are actually several different approaches that will work just fine.\n",
    "* We have already discussed EVERYTHING that you need to know in order to solve this problem.  That doesn't mean that it's simple, of course.  Programming is like Lego blocks.  You know a lot of little things, now you have to start putting them together into something big.\n",
    "* Draw pictures of the process to help you think through it."

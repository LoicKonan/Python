    "\n",
    "1. By adding more and more dunder methods, you can make your custom class interact with the rest of your program seamlessly and intuitively.\n",
    "2. Classes and Objects are **tools**... **mental models** to help us think through and express ideas.  In our examples, we have used classes to express `Point` and `Fraction` ideas.  Python provides classes to represent [date and time](https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/datetime.html), [zip files](https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/zipfile.html), [variable caching](https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/pickle.html), [database connections](https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/sqlite3.html), [Parsing HTML](https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/markup.html), [manipulating multimedia files](https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/mm.html), and even [data visualizations](https://matplotlib.org/).\n",
    "3. Read documentation to learn how to use libraries and their various classes.  If the libraries are designed well, then they will use consistent styles and patterns of code.  This is commonly referred to as being **pythonic**.  Developers often talk about writing **pythonic**, or **idiomatic**, code."

    "These two types of random numbers serve different purposes for programmers.  You may think that numbers should always be *completely* random, and sometimes that is true, but sometimes a programmer needs them to be *predictably* random.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Completely* random numbers are considered to be **true random**, and is used for cryptographic security.  But computers are **deterministic** machines, so true randomness is hard and slow to generate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most programs use **pseudorandom** numbers.  They are fast to generate, and \"random enough\" for most uses.  Pseudorandom numbers use a \"seed\" as a starting point.  The reason that we call these \"predictably random\" is that the sequence of random numbers that are generated are always the same, given the same starting seed.  Python can use the system clock to automatically set the seed.  Of course, this means that if two computers begin a script at the exact same moment, then they will generate the exact same sequence of random numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will focus on **pseudorandom** numbers.  Python generates random numbers using the `random` library (https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/random.html).\n",

    "\n",
    "* `random.seed()` - Sets a seed value for the pseudo-random number generation.\n",
    "* `random.randrange()` - Get a (pseudo) random integer value.  This function has 3 possible parameters, which are conceptually similar to the `range()` function.\n",
    "  * `random.randrange(10)` will return a random integer between 0 and 9 (inclusive).\n",
    "  * `random.randrange(5, 10)` will return a random integer between 5 and 9 (inclusive).\n",
    "  * `random.randrange(5, 10, 2)` will return a random integer between 5 and 9 (inclusive), but will have a \"skip\" of 2.  That means that the possible numbers will be 5, 7, or 9.\n",

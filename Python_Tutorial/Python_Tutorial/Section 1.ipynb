    "# Foundational Ideas\n",
    "\n",
    "The authoritative source for Python documentation is found at this website: https://docs.python.org/3.6/reference/index.html.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main versions of Python in use: **Python 2** and **Python 3**.  Python 2 has reached its end-of-life as of January 1, 2020, but it is still very common to encounter, especially in legacy projects.  Python 2, however, will no longer be receiving security updates, and so you should focus on Python 3 going forward.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most recent version of Python 3 is version 3.8, however Anaconda only ships with 3.6.  There are improvements and small changes introduced at each of the \"minor\" point updates, but 3.6 is a good, modern version to use.  Make sure that you are looking at the correct version of the documentation!\n",
    "\n",
    "## As a Script\n",
    "\n",
    "**Python** is a **scripting language**.  You, the programmer, write commands in the Python language, and a some helper program (the Python Interpreter) converts what you wrote into instructions that the computer can understand.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are using **Jupyter Notebooks** as our environment for writing snippets of Python in various **cells**.  Jupyter does not interpret the Python scripts, though.  There is a **Python kernel** running in the background (hidden) that Jupyter is communicating with.  In a sense, Jupyter is acting as a **communication bridge** between your script and the kernel.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Kernel\n",
    "\n",
    "The **kernel** is a Python interpreter.  It is **persistent**, meaning that it does not go away after your code finishes running.\n",
    "\n",
    "This can introduce interesting (dangerous) side effects if you do not protect against them.  While you do not yet know enough about Python to avoid the danger, it will be pointed out in the future when appropriate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each notebook instance has its own kernel, so any code that you run in one instance will not affect code running in another instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Important!!!\n",
    "\n",
    "The most important thing to know about the kernel is that it can fail.  This is not a fault of Python, but is the nature of any program.  In the context of Jupyter Notebooks, you need to know 2 things: **(1)** The kernel can be restarted, giving you a clean slate, and **(2)** if the kernel dies, a new one can be started.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why does the kernel get messed up?\n",
    "\n",
    "* It can happen when you leave the kernel running for a long time but you keep opening and closing your laptop.  I've seen this happen several times, in which a student says that all of the sudden their code doesn't work.  They've had the same Jupyter window open for a week, and we simply restart the kernel and it works again.\n",
    "* It can happen if you write faulty (but legal) code.  This is the equivalent to hitting your finger with a hammer.  Just restart the kernel, and don't run the faulty code again.  We will see examples of this behavior at a later time.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Cells\n",
    "\n",
    "In Jupyter Notebooks, you code is written in **cells**.  You can instruct Jupyter to run all of the cells in a Notebook at once (well... really it's sequentially), or you can run cells one at a time, in any order.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can run a single cell repeatedly, too.  Just remember that the **kernel is persistent**, meaning that it retains information (variable values, etc.) from one cell to the next."

    "## Comments\n",
    "\n",
    "**Comments are your best friend when it comes to programming.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Comments are annotations intended to be read by humans, but ignored by the Python interpreter.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, comments should not waste time or space explaining **what** your script is doing.  The code itself shows what you are doing.  (An exception, of course, is if you are giving a summary of a large section or documenting a function call.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Comments should explain **why** your code is doing whatever it is doing.\n",

    "## Variables and Types\n",
    " * Variables are a \"storage location\" for holding some value which can be used by a Python script.\n",
    " * The contents of a variable is referred to as its \"data\".\n",
    " * All data is of specific \"type\".\n",
    "     * You already do this intuitively.\n",
    "     * **3** is a number.  **\"Hello\"** is a word.\n",
    "     * Computers must be very exact in how they represent these types of data, and this can be confusing for beginners.\n",
    "     * To a computer, **3** is not just a number, but it is an **integer**.\n",
    "     * **3.0** is a floating point number.\n",
    "     * **\"3\"** is a string (not a number at all).\n",
    "     * These distinctions will make more sense as we learn more about programming.\n",
    " * There are many different data types.\n",
    "   * Built-in: https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/stdtypes.html\n",
    "   * Collections: https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/datatypes.html\n",
    " * We will focus on a few \"core\" data types.\n",
    " \n",
    "### Variable Rules\n",
    " \n",
    "Variables have a name provided by you, the programmer.  A variable name can be simple (e.g., `i`, as you see below) or complex (e.g., `my_first_variable`).\n",
    " \n",
    "Variable names have only a few guidelines:\n",
    "  * It can contain any combination of letters `a-z`, `A-Z`, numbers `0-9`, and the underscore `_` with a few restrictions, given below.\n",
    "      * The first character cannot be a number.\n",
    "      * It cannot be a [reserved word](https://docs.python.org/3.6/reference/lexical_analysis.html#keywords).\n",
    "  * Variable names should be **logical** and convey some meaning about what they represent.\n",
    "  * For consistency (and ease of reading your code) use a consistent variable name style.\n",
    "      * Underscores: `user_first_name`\n",
    "      * Camel Case: `userFirstName`"
